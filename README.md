# MySQL SAMPLE QUERIES
This sql file shows a few popular sql queries performed on a simple database. 
The queries interact with the data base in various forms and answer a few questions.
The data base used was **db_sql_practice** which had the tables, **customers**, **employees** and **orders**.
The write up code for the data base is included in the files on this repo
Towards the end of the queries, a new table named **persons** was manually created using MySQL worksheet instead of code.
