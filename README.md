# MySQL SAMPLE QUERIES
This sql file shows a few popular sql queries performed on a data base which was manually created on MySQL worksheet. 
The queries interact with the data base in various forms and answer a few questions.
The data base used was **db_sql_practice** which had the tables, **customers**, **employees** and **orders**.
The write up code for the data base creation will be included soon.
Towards the end of the queries, a new table named **persons** was manually created using MySQL worksheet instead of code.
